General notes to consider:
    * Propagator functions return a tuple of the shape
            True/False, [(Variable, value), ...]
      where False indicates that the propagator has reached
      a dead-end (in which case `bt_search` will backtrack),
      and True otherwise.

    * Propagator functions should not prune a value that has already
      been pruned.
      
    * `csp` is a required argument that represents the complete
      constraint satisfaction problem. Propagation functions will use
      this argument to access the variables and constraints that define
      the problem. Please read through the source code:
            `src/`
                `backtracking.py`
                `csp.py`
                `csp_constraint.py`
                `csp_variable.py`

    * `newVar` is an optional argument that represents the
      variable that has been most-recently assigned during search.
      If it is None, then the dedicated propagation algorithm will
      employ the logic described in the corresponding docstring
      to continue searching.
