The optimized game_of_life function parallelizes the computation across rows using OpenMP with static scheduling, allowing each thread to independently compute distinct rows. Pointer aliasing with restrict and local caching of indices improve vectorization and memory access speed. Branch-based wraparound replaces modulo operations to reduce overhead. Swapping pointers between generations eliminates costly memory copying. These optimizations maintain the original torus semantics while significantly reducing runtime. Additional performance was achieved by keeping inner loops tight, using local temporaries, and ensuring sequential memory access to leverage spatial and temporal locality, reducing cache misses. Other attempted optimizations included loop unrolling and manual prefetching, but the combination of parallelization, pointer swapping, and index caching yielded the most consistent and portable performance improvements across board sizes.
